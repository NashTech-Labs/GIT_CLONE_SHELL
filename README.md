This template contains scripts to install some basic or recommended tools to use terraform.

- Terraform is an infrastructure as code (IaC) tool that allows you to build, change and version infrastructure safely and efficiently.

- Visual studio code aka vscode is developer's favourite IDE for development due to it's extensive supports to various third party extensions

- Terratest is a Go library developed at Gruntwork, that makes it easier to write automated tests for our infrastructure code. Although you won't need this unless and until you want to test you IaC code.
